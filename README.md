Welcome to the Bash Scripting and Automation repository! This project showcases various Bash scripting examples covering fundamental and advanced concepts, such as variable usage, conditional statements, loops, arrays, functions, and file I/O operations.

## üß∞ Project Overview

This repository includes:

-   **Basic Bash Scripts**: Basic examples like `Hello World`, working with variables, arithmetic operations, string manipulation, and more.
-   **Conditionals**: Scripts demonstrating `if` statements, `else` statements, and nested conditionals for decision-making.
-   **Loops**: Examples of `for`, `while`, and `until` loops for iterative processes.
-   **Functions**: Creating reusable functions, including parameterized functions.
-   **Arrays**: Defining and manipulating arrays, accessing elements, and using loops to iterate over them.
-   **File Operations**: Reading and writing data to files, processing CSV files, and more.
-   **User Interaction**: Scripts that prompt the user for input and respond accordingly.
-   **Automation Examples**: Scripting real-world tasks such as adding, removing, and displaying items in arrays and manipulating files.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

-   **Modularity**: Scripts organized into logical sections for easy navigation.
-   **User-Friendly**: Commands with prompts and outputs are easy to follow, suitable for beginners and experienced users alike.
-   **Array Manipulation**: Real-world examples of adding and removing elements from arrays, displaying arrays, and using functions.
-   **File I/O**: Efficient handling of CSV data, reading and writing to files with `cat`, `read`, and `IFS`.
